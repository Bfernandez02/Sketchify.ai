# Sketchify.ai

1. Problem
Help those who are not artistically inclined create creative and innovative masterpieces
through a simple sketch, regardless of their skill level. This can be used by those trying to create
company logos, trying to create designs for things such as t-shirts or other clothing items, or by
people just trying to have some fun.
2. Objectives
Create a user-friendly web app, with potential for a mobile app, or mobile-compatible
web app, that can allow users to transform simple, quick sketches into aesthetic well-refined
images. Users should be able to draw their own sketches inside a component on the website
itself, or possibly upload their own sketch image. It should be reasonably fast, with several free
uses available (per day/week/or all time) and an optional pro version for unlimited use. Simple
enough for all ages to use.
3. Importance
This project is important as there currently is a gap in the market for a simple, cheap and
effective software to generate images just from a basic sketch. This can not only help people as
stated in the problem statement but also those with disabilities who would benefit greatly from a
software like this.
4. Description
The user sketches an image, which is then processed by GPT-4o-mini and prompt
engineering to identify key characteristics of the sketch. This information is used to generate a
detailed prompt, which is fed to the Stability AI model. The AI model then generates the image,
which is displayed to the user within the app.
In addition, this application will be both a webapp and a mobile app, both in which the
user can make their sketches and generate more realistic images. The application will have
authentication and profiles, allowing users to save sketches and images to their profiles, as well
as share them. With a focus on the front end, the design of the application will focus on
accessibility and improved use of the application for the user. The user is allowed to have one
sketch per day for free, but can purchase additional credits in the app. 1 credit allows the user to
generate 1 drawing based on their sketch.
This project combines the power of AI with human creativity, helping users turn their
ideas into artistic images.
