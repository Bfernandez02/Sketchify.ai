# Welcome to Sketchify.ai: AI-Powered Sketch-to-Image Generator

Sketchify.ai is a web and mobile application designed to help users transform simple sketches into refined, high-quality images using AI. Whether you're designing a company logo, creating custom t-shirt prints, or just having fun, this tool makes artistic creation accessible to everyone—no drawing skills required.

## Key Features
- Sketch & Generate: Users can draw directly on the app or upload their sketches.
- AI-Powered Image Creation: GPT-4o-mini interprets sketches and generates prompts for Stability AI to create detailed images.
- User Profiles & Credits: Users can save, share, and manage their sketches, with a free daily generation and an optional pro version for unlimited use.
- Cross-Platform Accessibility: Available as a web app with mobile compatibility.

## Problem
Help those who are not artistically inclined create creative and innovative masterpieces through a simple sketch, regardless of their skill level. This can be used by those trying to create company logos, trying to create designs for things such as t-shirts or other clothing items, or by people just trying to have some fun.
Software Engineering Process
	The agile development  process in which we will adopt will be the iterative development method. The flexible nature of an agile development process will allow us to make changes accordingly during the development process. Essentially, we will break down the project into “sprints.” Sprints in our case will be broken off into two weeks. Each sprint will be an iterative process in which an individual feature of the project will be broken into four distinct phases: understand the feature, design choices for the feature, implementation of the feature and then  testing each feature individually. We plan to uphold the principles of the iterative development method throughout the semester.

## Development Tools
The development tools in which will be utilized for the project will be the following:
Next.js (Front-End - Web App)
React Native (Front-End - Mobile App)
Firebase (Authentication/ Database tools)
Axios (API Calls)
Python
Flask (Backend)
Open AI (Chat-GPT 4o mini API)
Stability AI (For text to image generation)
	These tools listed above will be what we plan to use however, due to the agile nature of our development process these tools can change.
 
## Objectives
Create a user-friendly web app, with potential for a mobile app, or mobile-compatible web app, that can allow users to transform simple, quick sketches into aesthetic well-refined images. Users should be able to draw their own sketches inside a component on the website itself, or possibly upload their own sketch image. It should be reasonably fast, with several free uses available (per day/week/or all time) and an optional pro version for unlimited use. Simple enough for all ages to use.
Importance
	This project is important as there currently is a gap in the market for a simple, cheap and effective software to generate images just from a basic sketch. This can not only help people as stated in the problem statement but also those with disabilities who would benefit greatly from a software like this.
